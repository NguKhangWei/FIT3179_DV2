        <p><b>Participation</b> in the IMO is strongest in <b>Europe</b>, where countries like <b>Germany</b>, <b>Poland</b>, and <b>Romania</b> compete almost every year. Outside Europe, <b>USA</b>, <b>China</b>, and <b>Iran</b> show consistent involvement.</p>      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>Many countries in <b>Africa</b> and parts of the <b>Middle East</b> participate less frequently, showing regional disparities. In <b>South America</b>, <b>Brazil</b> stands out for its strong tradition in <b>mathematical Olympiads</b>.</p>      </div>

        <p>There are frequent battles for the <b>top spot</b> between the <b>United States</b> and <b>China</b>, with <b>South Korea</b> often steady in third. These shifts highlight the competitive nature of the <b>IMO upper ranks</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>In contrast, <b>India</b> and <b>Germany</b> consistently alternate in the lower top five, with limited upward movement. This pattern reflects the stability of top <b>contenders</b> and the challenge for others to rise.</p>

          <p>The chart shows country strengths across the <b>six</b> IMO problems. A key milestone occurred in 2022, when <b>China</b> became the first country where every team member scored full marks on all questions, an achievement unmatched in <b>IMO history</b>.</p>        </div>

        <div class="chart-text">
          <p>The chart tracks <b>male</b> and <b>female</b> participation since 2000, showing growth but a persistent <b>gender gap</b>. Fewer women compete partly due to limited access to advanced math training, though numbers are gradually improving.</p>        </div>

        <p>The line chart shows <b>average team scores</b> per student from 2000 to 2024, highlighting long-term trends. <b>China</b> consistently leads, often scoring above 35, while <b>Russia</b> and the <b>U.S.</b> alternate between second and third with periodic surges and dips.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>This highlights <b>China’s dominance</b> despite fluctuations, while the <b>U.S.</b> and <b>Russia</b> show more volatility. Notably, all three countries often converge around major competition years, suggesting synchronized cycles shaped by similar <b>preparation strategies</b>.</p>      </div>

        <p>The box plot shows variations in <b>individual scores</b> across countries from 2014 to 2024. <b>Vietnam</b> in 2020 had the widest gap between top and bottom performers, highlighting uneven team balance compared to more consistent top nations.</p>      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p><b>China</b> and the <b>United States</b> have notably short box plots, reflecting strong internal consistency. Trivia: China’s IMO teams are so uniformly strong that in several years, all six members earned <b>gold medals</b>, shown visually as near-flat ranges on the plot.</p>      </div>

        <p>The chart shows long-term trends in <b>performance</b> across the six IMO problems from 1981 to 2024. Most problems remain steady, but <b>P3</b> and <b>P6</b> have gradually declined, reflecting evolving difficulty and changing problem-solving approaches over time.</p>      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>This trend points to potential <b>strategy gaps</b>, as countries could focus on mastering recurring <b>P3</b> and <b>P6</b> types to gain an edge. Notably, <b>P3</b> is often called the “heartbreaker” of the IMO, famous for its elegant yet elusive logic that challenges even <b>gold medalists</b>.</p>      </div>
