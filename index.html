  <h1>Trends in IMO Performance, Participation and Contestant Consistency Over The Decades</h1>

        <p>Participation in the IMO is strongest in Europe, where countries like Germany, Poland, and Romania have taken part almost every year since the competition began. Outside Europe, nations such as the USA, China, and Iran also stand out for their long and consistent involvement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>Many countries in Africa and parts of the Middle East have participated less frequently, highlighting regional disparities in access to international math competitions. Interestingly, Brazil is one of the most active participants in South America, reflecting its strong tradition in mathematical Olympiads.</p>

    <!-- Bump -->

      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>The chart shows frequent battles for the top spot between the United States and China, with South Korea often holding steady in the third position. These shifts highlight how competitive the upper ranks of the IMO can be.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>In contrast, India and Germany consistently alternate in the lower part of the top five, with limited upward movement. This pattern underlines the stability of the top contenders and the challenge for others to break into higher ranks.</p>

        <div class="chart-text">
          <p>The chart reveals country strengths across the six IMO problems. A notable milestone was in 2022, when China became the first country where every team member scored full marks on all six questions, an achievement unmatched in IMO history.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Stacked -->
      <div class="chart-col">
        <div id="stacked" class="chart-half"></div>
        <div class="chart-text">
          <p>The chart tracks male and female participation since 2000, showing overall growth but a persistent gender gap. Fewer women compete partly due to unequal access to advanced math training, though gradual increases point to improving opportunities.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Line -->

    <div class="chart-text-row">
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>The line chart shows average team scores per student from 2000 to 2024, highlighting long-term performance trends. China consistently leads, often maintaining scores above 35, while Russia and the U.S. alternate between<br> second and third positions with periodic surges and dips.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>The visualization underscores how China’s dominance has remained steady despite fluctuations, while the U.S. and Russia show more volatility. Interestingly, the three countries often converge around major competition years, suggesting synchronized performance cycles influenced by shared preparation strategies.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Box -->

    <div class="chart-text-row">
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>The box plot captures variations in individual scores across countries from 2014 to 2024. Vietnam in 2020 shows the widest score gap between its best and weakest competitors, highlighting a year of uneven team balance compared to the more consistent distributions of top-performing nations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>China and the United States exhibit notably short box plots, a sign of remarkable internal consistency within their teams. Trivia: China’s IMO squads are so uniformly strong that, in multiple years, all six members have earned gold medals, an achievement that visually translates into the box plot’s near-flat ranges.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Stream -->

      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>The chart illustrates long-term trends in performance across the six IMO problems from 1981 to 2024. Most problems show steady results, but performance on P3 and P6 has gradually declined, suggesting evolving difficulty levels and shifting problem-solving approaches over the decades.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-text-col">
        <p>This pattern hints at potential strategy gaps, as countries could focus on mastering recurring P3 and P6 problem types to gain a competitive edge. Interestingly, P3 is often dubbed the “heartbreaker” of the IMO, famous for its elegant yet elusive logic that has challenged even gold medalists year after year.</p>

          <p>Asia shows strong and steady gold performance over time, while Europe and North America maintain mid-range levels with occasional peaks. Oceania and South America remain lighter overall, showing fewer top finishes. Gold dominance is clearly concentrated in Asia.</p>

      <div class="heatmap-pair">
        <div id="silver" class="heatmap-half"></div>
        <div class="heatmap-text">
          <p>Silver awards appear more balanced, with Asia and Europe leading steady performances. North America shows moderate results, while Oceania and South America lag slightly. The even tones suggest broader competitiveness compared to gold medals.</p>

      <div class="heatmap-pair">
        <div id="bronze" class="heatmap-half"></div>
        <div class="heatmap-text">
          <p>Bronze awards are widely distributed, with Asia and Europe still strong but more regions earning podium finishes. South America and Oceania show frequent presence, reflecting broader international competitiveness at this level.</p>
